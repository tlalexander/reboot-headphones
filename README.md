About
===

A great sounding pair of large over the ear headphones for 50mm drivers.
Primarily designed for printing on a liquid SLA or MLSA style printer, not a
normal FDM/FFF printer!

Seriously though, the sound quality really blew me away. I compared to my friend's
expensive headphones and these are surprisingly comparable. Way better than
my cheap $40 bluetooth headphones and really has made it a joy to listen to music!

I printed mine on my Elegoo Mars Pro, a $300 printer. This would also work with
the Anycubic Photon, Prusa SL1, etc.

Parts required
===

Find the STL files zipped up in the 3d_models folder.
Print one headband on an FFF/FDM style printer.
Print one head pad, then two of everything else using an MSLA or other resin
based printer.
Except do not print the "Foam Ear Pad".
I found that the "Speaker Casing" part prints nicely in a fully vertical
orientation. I was actually able to print two side by side.

Be advised: The headband is not adjustable. You will likely need to log in to
onshape and change the headband dimensions, then export that part as STL and
print your updated version. If you want a cool project, experiment with
designing an adjustable headband and please let me know when you've done it!

I designed these headphones for the following foam earpads.

You will need two of these or similar drivers:
https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/peerless-by-tymphany/HPD-50N25PR00-32/6211129
Driver Manufacturer: Peerless by Tymphany
Driver Part Number: HPD-50N25PR00-32

You will need to solder a headphone cable to the drivers.
I purchased this cord and cut one end off.

I wired mine so that the above cord hangs off the left side by just a few inches.
I then use the following extension to connect to the audio source.

This serves as a strain relief if you catch the cord and can make transportation
easier.

Finally you will require several different sizes of plastite-style screws.
Plastite screws work extremely well for holding plastic parts together, and are
in many cases much easier to use than your standard M3 screw and nut.

I used these screws in the design:

https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B00GDY8I92/

And then I need to check but the inside of the headphones uses one of these sizes:

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GDXU4WM/

Sorry but I will try to update that with certainty when I have a moment to open
them up.
